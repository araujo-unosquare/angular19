What is component based architecture?
CBA involves defining the components which are the basic building blocks of any Angular app.

Structure for a component? 
Generally a copmonent has
- html
-css
-ts
- testing file


Difference between index.html and app.component.html
index.html is used for defining global components or declarationas and libraries
app.component.html is used to building the app. parent component


What is interpolation?
It's a technoque used to bind data from a component class to the view template. It uses {{}}

Interpolate undefined?
it will render empty string

diff interpolation and property binding
Interpolation treats all data types as strings
Property binding is used when we want to set element's property to non-string


syntax
[proeprty]="variable"


explain data flow in event binding
In evt binding the data flows from dom to component. when evt is triggerd, the bond method from component gets called

diff evt and property binding
evt - data is sent from dom to component
prop - data from component to view

what is $event
represents the dom event object that is passed to an evt handler when an evt is triggered. it contains info about the event, suchas target etc.

how to use $event to prevent default behaviour
event.preventDefault()

additional arguments?
(click)="onClick($event, 'hello')"

common use cases for $event
input values
preventing defaultstop propagation
key events

what is 2 way binding
Two-way binding in Angular provides a mechanism for automatic synchronization of data between the component's data model and the view (UI elements). This means that changes made in the data model are immediately reflected in the view, and conversely, changes made by the user in the view (e.g., through input fields) are immediately reflected in the data model.

pitfalls of 2 way binding
tight coupling
performance
